Thanks for your interest in OpenSolid! Currently, the best way to contribute is
simply to [open a new issue](https://github.com/opensolid/geometry/issues) for
any new features you're interested in or any bugs you notice (including things
like misleading or confusing documentation - documentation issues are just as
important as code issues!). If you're willing to help fix the issue/implement
the feature, please mention that in the issue, but it's certainly not a
requirement!

In the long term, it is intended that there will be an established process for
accepting contributions via pull requests, and ultimately by adding core
collaborators to the OpenSolid organization on GitHub, but none of this is in
place yet.

If you are interested in the issues around open source governance, I would love
your thoughts on this in general, but right now specifically on the issue of
Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) - should one be required for OpenSolid
contributors, or is that overkill? Is it enough for it to be implicitly
understood that contributed code uses the same license as existing code? I don't
want to scare off potential contributors, and I have no interest in requiring
anyone to sign an onerous CLA that dumps legal liability on them, but I am
committed to this project for the long term and want to make sure that it's on
good legal footing.
