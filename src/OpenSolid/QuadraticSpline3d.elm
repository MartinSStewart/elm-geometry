A `QuadraticSpline3d` is a quadratic [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
in 3D defined by three control points. This module contains functionality for

  - Evaluating points and derivatives along a spline
  - Scaling, rotating, translating or mirroring a spline
  - Converting a spline between local and global coordinates in different
    reference frames
