{-| A `QuadraticSpline2d` is a quadratic [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
in 2D defined by three control points. This module contains functionality for

  - Evaluating points and derivatives along a spline
  - Scaling, rotating, translating or mirroring a spline
  - Converting a spline between local and global coordinates in different
    reference frames

Splines can be constructed by passing a tuple of control points to the
`QuadraticSpline2d` constructor, for example

    exampleSpline =
        QuadraticSpline2d
            ( Point2d ( 1, 1 )
            , Point2d ( 3, 4 )
            , Point2d ( 5, 1 )
            )

{-| Construct a spline from its three control points. This is the same as just
using the `QuadraticSpline2d` constructor directly;

    QuadraticSpline2d.bezier p1 p2 p3

is equivalent to

    QuadraticSpline2d ( p1, p2, p3 )
